# Data Analytics & Business Intelligence Portfolio

Hi, I'm Lynn Clemons, an aspiring Data and BI Analyst based in Ozark, AL. I am currently completing my BSBA in Data Analytics and finalizing Google Data Analytics & Business Intelligence Certifications. My professional focus is on applying data analysis and business intelligence to business and commercial environments, with an emphasis on turning complex data into practical insights that support strategic decision-making, operational efficiency, and revenue-aligned outcomes. I am particularly interested in analytics work that sits at the intersection of business strategy, performance measurement, and scalable decision support across industries such as technology, travel, services, and global operations.

This repository showcases my ability to translate raw, structured datasets into clear, defensible insights using transparent, well-documented methodologies. The projects emphasize thoughtful problem framing, data integrity, and interpretability, reflecting how analytics is used in real organizations to inform leadership decisions, optimize processes, and evaluate performance over time.

Rather than focusing on automation for its own sake, these projects demonstrate a business-first analytics mindset: understanding the question behind the data, selecting appropriate analytical approaches, and communicating results in a way that supports action. The work here reflects the type of analysis commonly used in business intelligence, operations analytics, and strategic advisory contexts, where clarity, trust in the data, and long-term impact matter.
